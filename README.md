# Simple Registration and Login Form with Homepage

## Project Overview

This project was my **first assignment as a Front-End Developer Intern**. The goal was to create a **simple registration form**, a **login system**, and a **homepage** using modern web technologies. 
The project was designed using **Bootstrap** for styling and layout, **Mustache.js** for templating, and **Path.js** for client-side routing. 
The data is stored in the browser's **localStorage**, and **MockAPI** was used to simulate backend API interactions. The project also includes **form validations** to ensure user input integrity.

## Features

- **Registration Form**: Allows users to sign up with essential details, including form validations.
- **Login System**: Users can log in using previously registered credentials.
- **Homepage**: A homepage that users are redirected to after a successful login.
- **Bootstrap Design**: The entire UI is styled with Bootstrap for a clean layout.
- **Mustache.js Templating**: Dynamic content rendering using the Mustache.js templating engine.
- **Path.js for Routing**: Implemented client-side routing to switch between registration, login, and homepage without page reloads.
- **localStorage**: Used localStorage for data persistence, ensuring that registered users and session states are maintained.
- **MockAPI**: Integrated MockAPI to simulate backend operations for user registration and login.
- **Form Validations**: Includes input validations such as email format, username uniqueness, and required fields to ensure proper data entry.
